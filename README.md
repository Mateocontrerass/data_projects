# Data Science Repo

## Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository!

Here you will find a collection of my data science projects showcasing my skills and expertise on the field. Along each project you can see the technologies I used, the results and the description of the problem.

### **1. Transaction Fraud Detection**
- __Description:__ A new company just arrived in Colombia with a groundbreaking proposal, to facilitate the management of fraudulent credit card transactions. However, the company does not have a model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not so our main goal will be to build and test it.
- __Technologies:__ Polars, Scikit, XGBoost, Numpy.
- __Results:__ When the model is used on unseen data the profits are near $306 MM.
